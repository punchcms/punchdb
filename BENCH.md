# punchdb Benchmarks

Performance benchmarks for the Pebble-backed `punchdb.Store` implementation.
The focus is the hot path: single-key reads/writes and scans. All benchmarks
report allocations via `-benchmem`.

## Analysis

### Write path — zero allocation

`Set` and `Delete` allocate **nothing** on the hot path (0 allocs/op). The
small `B/op` figures (5 and 4 bytes) come from Pebble's internal buffers being
reused, not from new allocations. Writes use `pebble.NoSync`; the WAL provides
durability without an `fsync` per operation.

### Read path — one intentional allocation

`Get` shows exactly **1 alloc/op (128 B)** — this is the **safe copy** of the
value. Pebble returns a slice bound to an internal closer; copying it before
closing guarantees the caller can retain the bytes safely. This allocation is
deliberate and documented. A zero-copy variant (`GetInto(dst []byte)`) could be
added later for callers who manage their own buffers.

### Batch commit

`BatchCommit` commits a 100-operation batch atomically (~246 ns per operation
amortized). The ~300 allocations are dominated by the benchmark's own key
construction (`fmt.Sprintf` + `[]byte` conversion ≈ 2 allocs/op); Pebble's
batch internals add roughly one more per op. In real workloads with pre-built
keys, the batch path is effectively allocation-light. Batching also collapses
many writes into a single WAL commit, reducing I/O overhead.

### Scans

Both scans allocate a **constant** number of times regardless of how many keys
are visited (2–3 allocs total), because the iterator is reused across the loop:

- `PrefixScan` stops after 10 keys via `ErrStopIteration` (~100 ns/key).
- `ScanFull` walks all 100 keys (~38 ns/key).

This makes cursor-based pagination cheap: the cost is driven by the page size,
not the total dataset size (O(1) seek, no OFFSET scanning).

## Running Benchmarks

```bash
# All benchmarks with allocation reporting
go test ./pebble -bench=. -benchmem -run=^$

# A single benchmark, longer run for stability
go test ./pebble -bench=BenchmarkSet -benchmem -run=^$ -benchtime=5s

# Compare before/after a change (requires benchstat)
go test ./pebble -bench=. -benchmem -run=^$ -count=5 > old.txt
# ... make change ...
go test ./pebble -bench=. -benchmem -run=^$ -count=5 > new.txt
benchstat old.txt new.txt
```

## Methodology Notes

- **`Set`/`Delete`** reuse a pre-allocated key buffer (`key[:0]` +
  `strconv.AppendInt`), so measured allocations are Pebble's, not key
  construction's.
- **`Get`** reads a 128-byte value; the reported 128 B/op is the safe copy.
- **`BatchCommit`** builds keys with `fmt.Sprintf` inside the loop; those
  allocations belong to the benchmark, not to the batch commit itself.
- **`PrefixScan`/`ScanFull`** iterate over a pre-populated keyspace
  (1000 and 100 keys respectively).
- Each benchmark opens an isolated store in a fresh temp directory
  (`b.TempDir()`), so runs do not interfere with each other.
- Defaults under test: 64MB cache, 64MB memtable, CPU/2 compaction threads,
  64 open files (`punchdb.DefaultOptions()`).
